The first argument of any route method in a `MockServer` instance is the request pattern. This pattern can be a string or a an object with additional fields to match. This allows you to create more complex routes that match specific requests, which is useful when you have many requests that differ only slightly from each other.

## Extended request pattern keys

The following keys can be used in the request pattern object:

-   `url` (required) - the URL to match.
-   `query` - query string parameters to match. Note that any URL containing all of the query string parameters is considered a match, even if the URL contains more query string parameters then are mentioned in the request pattern.
-   `params` - URL parameters to match. Used when the URL contains placeholders such as `:userId`.
-   `headers` - HTTP headers to match. Similar to `query`, a request containing all headers in the request pattern is considered a match even if the request contains additional headers.
-   `body` - the body of the request to match. This can be a string, `FormData`, or an object (in which case it's treated as JSON). For objects and `FormData`, the matching works similar to `query` and `headers`.

You can use any combination of these keys to create a request pattern that matches the requests to which you'd like to respond.

## Matching a URL with query parameters

If you'd like to match a URL that contains specific query parameters, you can use the `query` key in the request pattern object. Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.get(
	{
		url: "/users",
		query: {
			userId: "123",
		},
	},
	200,
);
```

This route will match any GET request to `/users` that contains a query parameter `userId` with the value `123`. For example, a request to `https://api.example.com/users?userId=123` will match this route.

## Matching a URL with URL parameters

If you'd like to match a URL that contains URL parameters, you can use the `params` key in the request pattern object. Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.get(
	{
		url: "/users/:userId",
		params: {
			userId: "123",
		},
	},
	200,
);
```

This route will match any GET request to `/users/:userId` where the `userId` parameter is `123`. For example, a request to `https://api.example.com/users/123` will match this route but a request to `https://api.example.com/users/456` will not.

You can use [URLPattern syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API#pattern_syntax) for more complex URL matching.

## Matching a request with specific headers

If you'd like to match a request that contains specific headers, you can use the `headers` key in the request pattern object. Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.get(
	{
		url: "/users",
		headers: {
			Authorization: "Bearer token",
		},
	},
	200,
);
```

This route will match any GET request to `/users` that contains an `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer token`.

## Matching a request with a specific body

If you'd like to match a request that contains a specific body, you can use the `body` key in the request pattern object. Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.post(
	{
		url: "/users",
		body: {
			name: "John Doe",
		},
	},
	200,
);
```

This route will match any POST request to `/users` that contains a JSON body with the `name` property set to `John Doe`. There's no need to set a specific `Content-Type` header; the matching is done based on the body content.

## Matching a request with a `Blob` body

If you'd like to match a request that contains a `Blob` body, you must manually set the `Content-Type` header and `body` to match what is contained in the `Blob`. Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";
const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

// assuming this is the blob you want to match when it is received
const blob = new Blob([JSON.stringify({ name: "John Doe" })], {
	type: "application/json",
});

server.post(
	{
		url: "/users",
		headers: {
			"Content-Type": blob.type,
		},
		body: {
			name: "John Doe"
		}
	},
	200,
);
```

This route will match any POST request to `/users` that contains a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json` and a body that matches the JSON object `{ name: "John Doe" }`. This includes requests that manually set these values as well as requests where the body is a `Blob` instance with the same content. 

<Aside type="caution">
The `type` you set for `Blob` might be changed by the runtime. For example, Bun will change `text/plain` to `text/plain;charset=utf-8`, and does the same for all text MIME types, including `application/json`. For this reason, it's best to create a `Blob` and use the `type` from the `Blob` instance itself when setting the `Content-Type` header for a request pattern intended to match a `Blob`.
</Aside>
<Aside type="info">
The `body` of the request pattern cannot be a `Blob` instance. You must manually set the `Content-Type` and `body` to match what is contained in the `Blob`.
</Aside>

## Match multiple request patterns

You can use any combination of the keys above to create a request pattern that matches the requests you'd like to respond to. For example, you can match a request that contains specific query parameters, URL parameters, headers, and body content.

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.post(
	{
		url: "/users/:userId",
		params: {
			userId: "123",
		},
		headers: {
			"Content-Type": "application/json",
		},
		body: {
			name: "John Doe",
		},
	},
	200,
);
```

This route will match any POST request to `/users/:userId` where the `userId` parameter is `123`, the request contains a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`, and the request body is a JSON object with the `name` property set to `John Doe`.
