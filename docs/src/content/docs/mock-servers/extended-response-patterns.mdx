title: Extended Response Patterns
description: Learn how to use extended response patterns with a mock server
---

The second argument of any route method in method in a `MockServer` instance is the response pattern. This pattern can be a number (the HTTP status to return), an object specifying additional data to return with the response, or a function. This is helpful when you're making requests that expect a specific response format.

## Extended response pattern keys

The following keys can be used in the response pattern object:

-   `status` (required) - the HTTP status code to return.
-   `headers` - HTTP headers to return with the response.
-   `body` - the body of the response to return. This can be a string, an object (which is treated as JSON), or an `ArrayBuffer`.
-   `delay` - the number of milliseconds to wait before returning the response.

The response pattern keys are used to create a new `Response` object that is returned when the associated request pattern matches the request.

### Respond with a specific status code

If you'd like to respond to a request with a specific status code, you can use the `status` key in the response pattern object. Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.get("/users", {
	status: 200,
});
```

This route will respond to any GET request to `/users` with a status code of 200. Of course, if you are only returning a status code, you can pass the status code as the second argument to the route method:

```js
server.get("/users", 200);
```

### Respond with specific headers

If you'd like to respond to a request with specific headers, you can use the `headers` key in the response pattern object. Here's an example that simulates a redirect:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.get("/redirect", {
	status: 301,
	headers: {
		Location: "https://example.com",
	},
});
```

This route will respond to any GET request to `/redirect` with a status code of 301 and a `Location` header that redirects the client to `https://example.com`.

### Respond with a specific body

If you'd like to respond to a request with a specific body, you can use the `body` key in the response pattern object. Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.get("/users", {
	status: 200,
	body: {
		id: 123,
		name: "Alice",
	},
});
```

This route will respond to any GET request to `/users` with a status code of 200 and a JSON response body containing an `id` and `name` property. There's no need to call `JSON.stringify` on the object; Mentoss will handle that for you.

### Respond with a specific body and headers

You can combine the `headers` and `body` keys in the response pattern object to respond to a request with specific headers and a specific body. Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.get("/users", {
	status: 200,
	headers: {
		"Content-Type": "application/json",
	},
	body: {
		id: 123,
		name: "Alice",
	},
});
```

This route will respond to any GET request to `/users` with a status code of 200, a `Content-Type` header of `application/json`, and a JSON response body containing an `id` and `name` property.

### Delay the response

If you'd like to delay the response to a request, you can use the `delay` key in the response pattern object. The `delay` property is the number of milliseconds to wait before returning the response. Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.get("/users", {
	status: 200,
	delay: 1000, // delay the response by 1 second
});
```

This route will respond to any GET request to `/users` with a status code of 200, but it will wait for 1 second before returning the response.

## Use functions for dynamic responses

If you'd like to respond to a request with a dynamic value, you can use a function as the response pattern. The function will receive the request object as its only argument and should return a response pattern object. Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.get("/users/123", request => {
	
	console.log(`Received request: ${request.id}`);
	
	return {
		status: 200,
		body: {
			id: "123",
			name: "Alice",
		},
	};
});
```

This route will respond to any GET request to `/users/123` with a status code of 200 and a JSON response body containing an `id` and `name` property. The response is generated dynamically based on the request object. The `request` object contains information about the request, such as the URL, headers, and body, and contains an additional `id` property that is a unique identifier for the request.

Response creator functions can also by asynchronous, so you can use `await` to wait for a promise to resolve before returning the response pattern object. Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

server.get("/users/123", async request => {
	await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
	
	return {
		status: 200,
		body: {
			id: "123",
			name: "Alice",
		},
	};
});
```

This route will respond to any GET request to `/users/123` with a status code of 200 and a JSON response body containing an `id` and `name` property, but it will wait for 1 second before returning the response. You can use this to simulate network latency or other asynchronous behavior when the `delay` key is not sufficient.

### Access request context in response creators

Response creator functions receive a second argument that provides access to additional request context information. This object contains:

- `cookies` - A `Map` containing any cookies sent with the request
- `params` - An object containing any URL parameters matched in the route pattern
- `query` - A `URLSearchParams` object containing any query string parameters

Here's an example showing how to use this context:

```js
import { MockServer } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

// Match URLs like /users/123
server.get("/users/:id", (request, { cookies, params, query }) => {
    
    // Access cookies
    const sessionId = cookies.get("sessionId");
    
    // Access URL parameters
    const userId = params.id;
    
    // Access query string parameters
	const format = query.get("format") ?? "json";
    
    return {
        status: 200,
        body: {
            userId,
            sessionId,
            format
        }
    };
});
```

The context argument makes it easy to implement realistic API behaviors that depend on these request details.
