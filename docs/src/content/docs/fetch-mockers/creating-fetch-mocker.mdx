description: Learn how to create a fetch mocker to mock the fetch() function
---

A _fetch mocker_ in Mentoss is how you create a mocked version of a `fetch()` function. Fetch mockers are used to intercept calls to `fetch()` and return responses that you've defined in your mock servers. This allows you to test your code without making real network requests.

## Create a new `FetchMocker` instance

To get started, import the `FetchMocker` class and create a new instance. The only argument is an object with the following properties:

-   `servers` (required) - an array of `MockServer` instances to use for mocking fetch requests

Here's an example:

```js
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";

const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");

const mocker = new FetchMocker({
	servers: [server],
});
```

With your fetch mocker created, you can now use it to mock the `fetch()` function.

## Use the mocked `fetch()` function

There are two ways to use a mocked `fetch()` function:

1. Use the `fetch()` function exported from the fetch mocker
1. Mock the global `fetch()` function and then use it as usual

### Use the exported `fetch()` function

Each `FetchMocker` instance creates a `fetch()` function that can be extracted and used in place of the global `fetch()` function. Here's an example:

```js {10-11, 22-23}
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";
import { expect } from "chai";

describe("My API", () => {
	const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");
	const mocker = new FetchMocker({
		servers: [server],
	});

	// extract the fetch function
	const myFetch = mocker.fetch;

	// reset the server after each test
	afterEach(() => {
		mocker.clearAll();
	});

	it("should return a 200 status code", async () => {
		// set up the route to test
		server.get("/ping", 200);

		// make the request
		const response = await myFetch("https://api.example.com/ping");

		// check the response
		expect(response.status).to.equal(200);
	});
});
```

In this example, the `fetch()` function is extracted from the `mocker` instance and used to make a request to the server. This allows you to use the mocked `fetch()` function without affecting the global `fetch()` function, which can be useful in certain testing scenarios.

### Mock the global `fetch()` function

If you want to mock the global `fetch()` function, you can use the `mockGlobal()` and `unmockGlobal()` methods provided by the fetch mocker. Here's an example:

```js {12-15, 22-25, 31-32}
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";
import { expect } from "chai";

describe("My API", () => {
	let mocker;

	const server = new MockServer("https://api.example.com");
	mocker = new FetchMocker({
		servers: [server],
	});

	// mock the global fetch function
	before(() => {
		mocker.mockGlobal();
	});

	// reset the server after each test
	afterEach(() => {
		mocker.clearAll();
	});

	// unmock the global fetch function
	after(() => {
		mocker.unmockGlobal();
	});

	it("should return a 200 status code", async () => {
		// set up the route to test
		server.get("/ping", 200);

		// make the request
		const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/ping");

		// check the response
		expect(response.status).to.equal(200);
	});
});
```

In this example, the `mockGlobal()` method is called before the tests to mock the global `fetch()` function. The `unmockGlobal()` method is called after the tests to restore the original `fetch()` function. This allows you to use the mocked `fetch()` function in your tests without affecting other parts of your code that rely on the global `fetch()` function.

### Mock `fetch()` on specific objects

You can also mock the `fetch()` function on specific objects using the `mockObject()` and `unmockObject()` methods. This is useful when you want to mock `fetch` only in certain contexts or on specific objects. Here's an example:

```js
const myApi = {
    fetch: globalThis.fetch,
    async getData() {
        return this.fetch("/api/data");
    }
};

// mock fetch only on myApi
mocker.mockObject(myApi);

// mock fetch with a custom property name
mocker.mockObject(myApi, "customFetch");

// restore original fetch functions
mocker.unmockObject(myApi);
```

This approach is particularly useful when:
- You want to mock `fetch` only for specific modules or objects
- You're working with objects that use a different property name for fetch
- You need to maintain different fetch implementations in different parts of your code
