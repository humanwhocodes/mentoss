The fetch mocker provides several methods to help verify that your requests were made as expected.

## Verifying Route Calls

Tracking which routes have been called is a key part of many tests. The fetch mocker provides several methods and properties to help with this.

### `allRoutesCalled()`

The `allRoutesCalled()` method checks if all routes have been called on all servers. It returns `true` if all routes have been called at least once, and `false` otherwise:

```js {10, 13, 16}
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";

const server1 = new MockServer("https://api1.example.com");
const server2 = new MockServer("https://api2.example.com");
const mocker = new FetchMocker({ servers: [server1, server2] });

server1.get("/users", 200);
server2.post("/users", 200);

console.log(mocker.allRoutesCalled()); // false

await mocker.fetch("https://api1.example.com/users");
console.log(mocker.allRoutesCalled()); // false

await mocker.fetch("https://api2.example.com/users", { method: "POST" });
console.log(mocker.allRoutesCalled()); // true
```

In this example, the `allRoutesCalled()` method first returns `false` because neither the GET nor the POST `/users` route has been called yet. After both routes have been called, the method returns `true`.

### `assertAllRoutesCalled()`

The `assertAllRoutesCalled()` method is an assertion that checks if all routes have been called. It throws an error if any routes have not been called:

```js {11}
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";

const server1 = new MockServer("https://api1.example.com");
const server2 = new MockServer("https://api2.example.com");
const mocker = new FetchMocker({ servers: [server1, server2] });

server1.get("/users", 200);
server2.post("/users", 200);

await mocker.fetch("https://api1.example.com/users");
server.assertAllRoutesCalled(); // Error!
```

The thrown error contains a message with information about the uncalled routes.

### `called()`

The `called()` method checks if a specific route has been called. You can pass either a URL string (which defaults to a GET request) or a request pattern object:

```js {17,26, 28-34}
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";

const server1 = new MockServer("https://api1.example.com");
const server2 = new MockServer("https://api2.example.com");
const mocker = new FetchMocker({ servers: [server1, server2] });

server1.post(
	{
		url: "/users",
		body: {
			name: "John Doe",
		},
	},
	200,
);

console.log(mocker.called("https://api1.example.com/users")); // false

await mocker.fetch("https://api1.example.com/users", {
    method: "POST",
    body: {
        name: "John Doe",
    },
});

console.log(mocker.called("https://api1.example.com/users")); // true

console.log(mocker.called({
    url: "https://api1.example.com/users",
    method: "POST",
    body: {
        name: "John Doe",
    },
})); // true
```

In this example, the `called()` method returns `false` because the `/users` route has not been called yet. The matching is done using the same comparison logic as if a `fetch()` request was made to the route.

### `uncalledRoutes`

The `uncalledRoutes` property returns an array with information about uncalled routes. You can use this property to check if any routes have not been called:

```js {12}
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";

const server1 = new MockServer("https://api1.example.com");
const server2 = new MockServer("https://api2.example.com");
const mocker = new FetchMocker({ servers: [server1, server2] });

server1.get("/users", 200);
server2.post("/users", 200);

await mocker.fetch("https://api1.example.com/users");

console.log(mocker.uncalledRoutes); // ["ðŸš§ [Route: POST https://api2.example.com/users -> 200]"]
```

The `uncalledRoutes` property is helpful when you want to format your own error messages or assertions.

<Aside type="tip">
The `MockServer` class also supports `allRoutesCalled()`, `assertAllRoutesCalled()`, and `called()` methods, as well as the `uncalledRoutes` property. These methods and property work similarly to the `FetchMocker` equivalents except they only check routes on the given server.

## Additional Helpers

### `clearAll()`

The `clearAll()` method removes all routes from all servers so you can reuse the same server for multiple tests.

```js {10}
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";

const server1 = new MockServer("https://api1.example.com");
const server2 = new MockServer("https://api2.example.com");
const mocker = new FetchMocker({ servers: [server1, server2] });

server1.get("/users", 200);
server2.post("/users", 200);

mocker.clearAll();

await mocker.fetch("https://api1.example.com/users"); // Error!
```
