The global `fetch()` function is available in many JavaScript runtimes, including server-side runtimes and web browsers. While `fetch()` works similarly in both environments, there are some important differences to take into account when testing code that uses `fetch()` in a browser environment.

## Relative URLs with `fetch()`

Perhaps the most significant difference between using `fetch()` in a browser as opposed to a server environment is how relative URLs are handled. When you use `fetch()` in a browser, relative URLs are resolved relative to the current page's URL. This means that if you call `fetch("/api/data")` from a page at `https://example.com/page`, the request will be made to `https://example.com/api/data`. This happens automatically in the browser whenever you use `fetch()`, ensuring that requests go to the correct server.

If you try to use a relative URL with `fetch()` in a server-side environment, you'll get an error. This is because the server doesn't know what the base URL should be, so it can't resolve the relative URL. That means the same `fetch()` call that works in the browser won't work in a server environment and it's important to keep that in mind when writing tests.

## Mocking Browser Requests with Mentoss

Mentoss provides a way to mock browser requests in your tests, allowing you to test code that uses `fetch()` without making actual network requests. To mock a browser request, you can provide a `baseUrl` option to the `FetchMocker` constructor. This option specifies the base URL that relative URLs should be resolved against. You can then call a mocked `fetch()` using a relative URL. Here's an example:

```js {10, 25-26}
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";
import { expect } from "chai";

const BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com";

describe("My API", () => {
	const server = new MockServer(BASE_URL);
	const mocker = new FetchMocker({
		servers: [server],
		baseUrl: BASE_URL,
	});

	// extract the fetch function
	const myFetch = mocker.fetch;

	// reset the mocker after each test
	afterEach(() => {
		mocker.clearAll();
	});

	it("should return a 200 status code", async () => {
		// set up the route to test
		server.get("/ping", 200);

		// make the request
		const response = await myFetch("/ping");

		// check the response
		expect(response.status).to.equal(200);
	});
});
```

In this example, the `baseUrl` option is set to `"https://api.example.com"`, which means that relative URLs will be resolved against that base URL. The test then calls `myFetch("/ping")`, which resolves to `"https://api.example.com/ping"` and makes a request to the server. This allows you to test code that uses relative URLs with `fetch()` in a browser-like environment.

<Aside type="caution">
	When using the `baseUrl` option with `FetchMocker`, make sure to set it to
	the correct base URL for your mock server. If you don't have a mock server
	defined for the base URL, the request will fail.

## Mocking CORS Requests

Another important consideration when mocking browser requests is how to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests. CORS is a security feature that restricts which domains can make requests to a server. When you make a request from one domain to another, the server must include the appropriate CORS headers to allow the request to go through. When you set the `baseUrl` option in the `FetchMocker` constructor, Mentoss automatically includes the appropriate CORS headers when a request is made to a different origin.

### Simple Requests

For [simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests), Mentoss automatically includes the `Origin` header on the request. If the server responds with the appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, your code will receive the response as expected. If the server does not respond with the appropriate header, the request will fail. Here's an example:

```js {19-21}
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";

const BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com";

describe("My API", () => {
	const server = new MockServer("https://www.example.com");
	const mocker = new FetchMocker({
		servers: [server],
		baseUrl: BASE_URL,
	});

	// extract the fetch function
	const myFetch = mocker.fetch;

	it("should return a 200 status code", async () => {
		// set up the route to test
		server.get("/ping", {
			status: 200,
			headers: {
				"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": BASE_URL,
			},
			body: { message: "pong" },
		});

		// make the request
		const response = await myFetch("https://www.example.com/ping");

		// check the response
		expect(response.status).to.equal(200);
	});
});
```

In this example, the server responds with the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header set to the base URL `"https://api.example.com"`. This allows the request to go through because the origin matches the origin of the fetch mocker's `baseUrl`, and the test passes.

### Preflighted Requests

For [preflighted requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#preflighted_requests), Mentoss automatically sends an `OPTIONS` request to the server to check if the request is allowed. If the server responds with the appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` headers, the original request will go through. If the server does not respond with the appropriate headers, the request will fail. Here's an example:

```js {16-23}
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";

const BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com";

describe("My API", () => {
	const server = new MockServer("https://www.example.com");
	const mocker = new FetchMocker({
		servers: [server],
		baseUrl: BASE_URL,
	});

	// extract the fetch function
	const myFetch = mocker.fetch;

	it("should return a 200 status code", async () => {
		// this is for the preflight request
		server.options("/ping", {
			status: 200,
			headers: {
				"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": BASE_URL,
				"Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
			},
		});

		// this is the route that we want to call
		server.get("/ping", {
			status: 200,
			headers: {
				"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": BASE_URL,
			},
			body: { message: "pong" },
		});

		// make the request
		const response = await myFetch("https://www.example.com/ping", {
			headers: {
				"Content-Type": "application/json",
			},
		});

		// check the response
		expect(response.status).to.equal(200);
	});
});
```

In this example, the code attempts a request to `"https://www.example.com/ping"`. Because this is a cross-origin request, Mentoss first sends an `OPTIONS` request to the server to check if the request is allowed. The server responds to the preflight request with the appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` headers, allowing the original request to go through.

### The Preflight Cache

When a browser makes a preflight request, it caches the response for a period of time (usually 5 minutes but customizable using the `Access-Control-Max-Age` header). This means that if you make the same request again within the cache period, the browser won't send another preflight request. Instead, it will use the cached response to determine if the request is allowed. Mentoss does not currently support caching preflight responses, so each preflight request will result in a new preflight request to the server.

Mentoss caches preflight responses in memory for the duration of the test run. This means that if you make the same preflighted request multiple times within a single test, Mentoss will only send the `OPTIONS` request once. However, you can manually clear the preflight cache by calling the `clearPreflightCache()` method. It's helpful to do this after each test

```js {15-18}
import { MockServer, FetchMocker } from "mentoss";

const BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com";

describe("My API", () => {
	const server = new MockServer("https://www.example.com");
	const mocker = new FetchMocker({
		servers: [server],
		baseUrl: BASE_URL,
	});

	// extract the fetch function
	const myFetch = mocker.fetch;

	// clear preflight cache entries
	afterEach(() => {
		mocker.clearPreflightCache();
	});

	it("should return a 200 status code", async () => {
		// this is for the preflight request
		server.options("/ping", {
			status: 200,
			headers: {
				"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": BASE_URL,
				"Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
			},
		});

		// this is the route that we want to call
		server.get("/ping", {
			status: 200,
			headers: {
				"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": BASE_URL,
			},
			body: { message: "pong" },
		});

		// make the request
		const response = await myFetch("https://www.example.com/ping", {
			headers: {
				"Content-Type": "application/json",
			},
		});

		// check the response
		expect(response.status).to.equal(200);
	});
});
```

<Aside type="tip">
	The preflight cache is also cleared when you call `mocker.clearAll()`, so
	you don't need to call `mocker.clearPreflightCache()` if you're already
	calling `mocker.clearAll()`.

<Aside type="caution">
While CORS support is mostly complete, credentialed requests (requests that include cookies or HTTP authentication information) are not yet supported. Mentoss throws an error if you try to use a credentialed request.
